Carlos Bornes is a postdoctoral researcher at Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic. He is interested in characterizing porous materials using a combination of experimental methods such as solid-state NMR, vibrational spectroscopy, and inelastic neutron scattering, along with computational methods. Currently, his work focuses on developing machine-learning methods that enable long molecular dynamical simulations of zeolites under operando conditions, and the prediction of experimental observables such as NMR tensors.
