abstract: Under operating conditions, the dynamics of water and ions confined within protonic aluminosilicate zeolite micropores are responsible for many of their properties, including hydrothermal stability, acidity and catalytic activity. However, due to high computational cost, operando studies of acidic zeolites are currently rare and limited to specific cases and simplified models. In this work, we have developed a general reactive neural network potential (NNP) attempting to cover the entire class of acidic zeolites, including the full range of experimentally relevant water concentrations and Si/Al ratios. This NNP combines dramatic sampling acceleration, retaining the reference metaGGA DFT level, with the capacity for discovery of new chemistry, such as collective defect formation mechanisms at the zeolite surface. Furthermore, we exemplify how the NNP can be used as a basis for further extensions/improvements which include data-efficient adoption of higher-level (hybrid) references via Δ-learning and the acceleration of rare event sampling via automatic construction of collective variables. These developments represent a significant step towards accurate simulations of realistic catalysts under operando conditions.
