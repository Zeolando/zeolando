abstract  ="Solid state (ss-) 27Al NMR is one of the most valuable tools for the experimental characterization of zeolites{,} owing to its high sensitivity and the detailed structural information which can be extracted from the spectra. Unfortunately{,} the interpretation of ss-NMR is complex and the determination of aluminum distributions remains generally unfeasible. As a result{,} computational modelling of 27Al ss-NMR spectra has grown increasingly popular as a means to support experimental characterization. However{,} a number of simplifying assumptions are commonly made in NMR modelling{,} several of which are not fully justified. In this work{,} we systematically evaluate the effects of various common models on the prediction of 27Al NMR chemical shifts in zeolites CHA and MOR. We demonstrate the necessity of operando modelling; in particular{,} taking into account the effects of water loading{,} temperature and the character of the charge-compensating cation. We observe that conclusions drawn from simple{,} high symmetry model systems such as CHA do not transfer well to more complex zeolites and can lead to qualitatively wrong interpretations of peak positions{,} Al assignment and even the number of signals. We use machine learning regression to develop a simple yet robust relationship between chemical shift and local structural parameters in Al-zeolites. This work highlights the need for sophisticated models and high-quality sampling in the field of NMR modelling and provides correlations which allow for the accurate prediction of chemical shifts from dynamical simulations."}
