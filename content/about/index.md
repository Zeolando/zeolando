        Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates with a unique nanoporous structuremaking them versatile materials with a wide range of applications in catalysis, adsorption, separation, and environmental remediation. However, our understanding of how zeolites perform under *operando* conditions, i.e. condition used during the processes described above, is still very limited.

        The **Zeolando** (**Zeol**ite + Oper**ando**) project aims at unveilling the processes leading to the activity, selectivity, and deactivation of zeolite under *operando* conditions. To achieve this, the project will:

        - Develop equivariant reactive neural network potentials (NNPs) that can perfom long molecular dynamics simulation at the level of accuracy of DFT.

        - Use reactuve NNPs to explore mechanism of deactivation and dynamical behaviour of of Aluminum- and **Tin-containing zeolites** at *operando* conditions.

        - Explore the hability of equivariant NNPs to predict tensorial properties such as NMR Born effective charge tensors.
        
        – Investigate behaviour of zeolite catalysts at *operando* conditions using spectroscopic methods, such as solid-state NMR and vibrational spectroscopies.

        The Zeolando project holds immense promise for revolutionizing our understanding of zeolites and paving the way for their development as next-generation materials with enhanced efficiency and sustainability.

        Currently, we are waiting approval for funding from the **Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions Postdoctoral Fellowships**
