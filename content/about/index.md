      title: About the Project
      text: |
        Zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates with a unique nanoporous structure, making them versatile materials for a wide range of applications in catalysis, adsorption, separation, and environmental remediation. However, our understanding of how zeolites perform under *operando* conditions, i.e. conditions used during the processes described before, is still very limited.

        The **Zeolando** (**Zeol**ite + Oper**ando**) project aims to unveil the processes leading to the activity, selectivity, and deactivation of zeolite under *operando* conditions. To achieve this, the project will:

        - Develop equivariant reactive neural network potentials (NNPs) that can perform long molecular dynamics simulations at the level of accuracy of DFT.

        - Use reactive NNPs to explore the mechanism of deactivation and dynamical behaviour of Aluminum- and **Tin-containing zeolites** at *operando* conditions.

        - Explore the ability of equivariant NNPs to predict tensorial properties such as NMR Born effective charge tensors.
        
        - Investigate the behaviour of zeolite catalysts at *operando* conditions using spectroscopic methods, such as solid-state NMR and vibrational spectroscopies.

        The Zeolando project holds immense promise for revolutionizing our understanding of zeolites and paving the way for their development as next-generation materials with enhanced efficiency and sustainability.

        Currently, we are waiting for approval for funding from the **Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions Postdoctoral Fellowships**
