# Zeolando Project Website

This [Zeolando website](https://zeolando.com/) was created to showcase our research and provide a platform for connecting with our collaborators and the broader research community. We hope you find it informative and useful. The website is currently under construction while we wait for funding from the Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions Postdoctoral Fellowships. Wish us luck!

We have made some modifications to the original [Hugo Research Group Theme](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-research-group) to suit the specific needs of our project. These changes include:

We are grateful to the Wowchemy team for providing a flexible and customizable theme that enabled us to make these adjustments.
